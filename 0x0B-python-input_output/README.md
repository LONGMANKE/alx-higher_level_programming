### Resources
* [Methods of File Objects](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files) etc.

## General Requirements
**Python Script:**
* Allowed editors: **vi**, **vim**, **emacs**
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All files ends with a new line
* Python Scripts: The first line of all your files should be exactly **#!/usr/bin/python3**
* There is a **README.md** file, at the root of the folder of the project
* All files are executable
* All coded used the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)*

**Python Test Cases:**
* Allowed editors: **vi**, **vim**, **emacs**
* All files ends with a new line
* All test files are inside a folder tests
* All test files are text files with extension: ``.txt``)
* All tests are executed using the command: ``python3 -m doctest ./tests/*``
* All the modules have a documentation ``(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')``
* All functions have a documentation (``python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`` and <br> ``python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'``)
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case – The Checker is checking for tests!
